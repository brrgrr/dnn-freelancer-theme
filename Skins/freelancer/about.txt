Convert this static template to a DotNetNuke Theme.
Use what ever tools your most confortable with. This
will allow us to assess your skill level.

Instructions on completeing this task:
1. Create a site in IIS and set your app pool permision to site folder
    1. Use themeing.dnndev.me
2. Install the most current version of DNN platform
3. Determine which part of this theme are panes and which parts
   should be containers.
    1. Hint, this is required:
        I. <div id="ContentPane" runat="server"></div>
4. Be sure to use proper skin objects where needed
5. Don't be too concerned about getting the animation
   ( like autoscroll, bonus points if you do though ) to work.
   This is primarily to test, if you can use dnn skin objects, create
   panes, and containers.
5. When completed this static theme should be a working theme in DNN.
   If done correctly, I should be able to add modules to panes, drag and drop
   modules to other panes, have dnn control navigation and assign containers
   to a module.
